# Literally every package on npm

Did you ever just wake up and feel like installing every publicly visible package?

Did you ever want to contribute meaningfully to the npm ecosystem with the added benefit of completely obliterating every package.json that crosses your path?

Google already beat me to building a minimum spanning tree of the internet so I guess I'll settle for node.js

## Usage

1. Install this

`npm install literally-everything`

2. Install everything else

`literally-everything`
